class RencryptionLayer:
    """
    A class used to represent a layer which decrypts and then
    re-encrypts a nD matrix.
    While this is not a layer you would see in a CNN, this
    operation has been put in a layer to maintain coherence.

    Attributes
    ----------
    HE : Pyfhel
        Pyfhel object, used to perform the rencryption

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(self, HE)
        Constructor of the layer.

    __call__(self, t)
        Re-encrypts a nD matrix using the keys given by the HE object.
